  [33X[0;0YBoth [5XSCSCP[105X client and server for [5XGAP[105X work in Linux, OS X and Windows.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  use the [5XSCSCP[105X package it is necessary to install recent versions of [5XGAP[105X4
  packages [5XIO[105X [Neu], [5XGAPDoc[105X [LN] and [5XOpenMath[105X [CKNS].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [5XSCSCP[105X  package is distributed in standard formats ([11Xtar.gz[111X, [11Xtar.bz2[111X) and
  can  be  obtained from [7Xhttps://gap-packages.github.io/scscp/[107X or from the [5XGAP[105X
  web  site  (the  latter  also  offers  [11Xwin.zip[111X-archives).  To  install [5XSCSCP[105X
  package,  put  its  [11Xtar.gz[111X-archive  into  the  [11Xpkg[111X subdirectory of your [5XGAP[105X4
  installation  and  enter  the  command [10Xtar -xzf scscp-X.X.X.tar.gz[110X, then the
  subdirectory [11Xscscp[111X (containing subdirectories [11Xdoc[111X, [11Xlib[111X etc.) will be created
  in  the  [11Xpkg[111X  subdirectory.  Installation  using  other  archive  formats is
  performed in a similar way.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhen  there  are  no  access  rights  to  the root directory of the main [5XGAP[105X
  installation,  it  is  also  possible to install the package [13Xoutside the [5XGAP[105X
  main directory[113X by unpacking it inside a directory [11XMYGAPDIR/pkg[111X. Then to load
  the package [5XGAP[105X should be started with [10X-l ";MYGAPDIR"[110X option.[133X
  
  
  [1X2.2 [33X[0;0YConfiguration files[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere  are  four files in the package which may need to be modified to setup
  and  customise  the  package.  The  first  three  files are related with the
  server's functionality:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[11Xscscp/config.g[111X specifies:[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12Ydefault [10XInfoLevel[110X for the [2XInfoSCSCP[102X ([14X9.2-1[114X) class;[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12Ydefault  [5XSCSCP[105X server name and port to be used by [2XRunSCSCPserver[102X
              ([14X5.2-1[114X)  if  [5XGAP[105X  is  started  with the [11Xscscp/example/myserver.g[111X
              file;[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12Ywhether  the  server  accepts  calls  to  procedures  which  are
              standard  [5XOpenMath[105X  symbols, or only procedures installed in the
              transient    content   dictionary   (see   [2XInstallSCSCPprocedure[102X
              ([14X5.1-1[114X));[133X

  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[11Xscscp/gapd.sh[111X is the script to start the [5XGAP[105X [5XSCSCP[105X server as a daemon.
        To  use  it,  adjust  the  local  call  of [5XGAP[105X and, if necessary, call
        options  (for  example, memory usage, startup from the workspace etc.)
        and the location of the root directory of the [5XSCSCP[105X package in section
        1 of this script.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[11Xscscp/example/myserver.g[111X  is  an  example  of the server configuration
        file  which  loads  all  necessary  packages,  reads  all needed code,
        installs  all  procedures  which  will  be  exposed  to the client and
        finally starts the [5XSCSCP[105X server (see Chapter [14X5[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  fourth  file  is  related  with the client's functionality for parallel
  computations:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  file  [11Xscscp/configpar.g[111X  assigns the global variable [10XSCSCPservers[110X
        which specifies a list of hosts and ports to search for [5XSCSCP[105X services
        (which  may  be  not  only  represented  by  [5XGAP[105X services, but also by
        another  [5XSCSCP[105X-compliant  systems).  It  will  be used to run parallel
        computations with the [5XSCSCP[105X package (see Chapter [14X8[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSee comments in these configuration files for further details and examples.[133X
