  [33X[0;0YThe   [5XGAP[105X   package  [5XSCSCP[105X  implements  the  Symbolic  Computation  Software
  Composability  protocol  [FHK+b].  This protocol specifies an [5XOpenMath[105X-based
  remote  procedure call framework, in which all messages (procedure calls and
  returns  of results of successful computation or error messages) are encoded
  in [5XOpenMath[105X using content dictionaries [5Xscscp1[105X and [5Xscscp2[105X ([FHK+a], [FHK+c]).
  Using  the  [5XSCSCP[105X  package, [5XGAP[105X can communicate locally or remotely with any
  other  [5XOpenMath[105X-enabled  [5XSCSCP[105X-compliant  application  which may be not only
  another  computer algebra system but also another instance of the [5XGAP[105X system
  or  even,  for  example, an external Java or C/C++ application via libraries
  [7Xhttp://java.symcomp.org/[107X    or   [7Xhttp://www.imcce.fr/Equipes/ASD/trip/scscp/[107X
  providing  an [5XSCSCP[105X API. Such communication will go into seamless manner for
  the [5XGAP[105X user, since all conversions from [5XGAP[105X to [5XOpenMath[105X and vice versa will
  be   performed   in   the   background.   See   the   SCSCP   protocol  page
  [7Xhttps://www.openmath.org/standard/scscp/[107X  for  the  details  about  computer
  algebra systems and other sotware supporting [5XSCSCP[105X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe [5XSCSCP[105X package for [5XGAP[105X has two main components:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YSCSCP server;[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YSCSCP client.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere are several ways to start [5XGAP[105X [5XSCSCP[105X server:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ycall [2XRunSCSCPserver[102X ([14X5.2-1[114X) from the [5XGAP[105X session specifying the server
        name and the port number from the [5XGAP[105X session;[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ystart   [5XGAP[105X   as  [10Xgap  myserver.g[110X,  where  [11Xmyserver.g[111X  is  the  server
        configuration   file   with   the  last  command  being  the  call  of
        [2XRunSCSCPserver[102X ([14X5.2-1[114X) (an example of such configuration file is given
        in [11Xscscp/example/myserver.g[111X );[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ystart  [5XGAP[105X  as  a daemon using the script [11Xgapd.sh[111X which is supplied in
        the  root  directory  of  the  package  (for  the  description  of all
        available options see comments in [11Xgapd.sh[111X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YDuring  startup  the server installs all procedures that it will provide and
  loads  their  lookup  mechanisms, and then begins to listen to the specified
  port.  The recommended port number is 26133 which has been assigned to SCSCP
  by  the  Internet  Assigned  Numbers  Authority (IANA) in November 2007, see
  [7Xhttp://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers[107X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhen   the   server   accepts  a  connection  from  client,  it  starts  the
  "accept-evaluate-return" loop:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yaccepts the [10X"procedure_call";[110X message;[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yperforms lookup of the appropriate GAP function;[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yevaluates the result (or produces a side-effect);[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yreturns  the result in the [10X"procedure_completed"[110X message or returns an
        error in the [10X"procedure_terminated"[110X message.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  server  works in a "multi-user" mode. When one client is connected, the
  server is busy for other clients. As soon as the computation is finished and
  the  client  is disconnected, the server is waiting for the next connection,
  and  normally  it  never  stops  until  it will be terminated by the service
  provider.  The  server  maintain  a queue of five incoming connections (this
  parameter  can be easily modified), and on each iteration evaluates the next
  request from the queue.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere  is an [5XSCSCP[105X server accessible at [11Xscscp.gap-system.org[111X, port 26133. It
  is  running  under development versions of the [5XGAP[105X system and a selection of
  currently  distributed  packages.  The  reader  is  encouraged to try to use
  examples  from  the  manual to access this service, replacing [11X"localhost"[111X by
  its  address, where appropriate. Please report to Alexander Konovalov if you
  will discover any bugs or if the server seems not available.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe SCSCP client:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yestablishes  connection  with  the  specified  server at the specified
        port;[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ysends the [10X"procedure_call"[110X message to the server;[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ywaits  for  the  result  of  the  computation or returns to pick it up
        later;[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yfetches    the    response,    extracting    the   result   from   the
        [10X"procedure_completed"[110X  message  or entering the break loop in the case
        of the [10X"procedure_terminated"[110X message.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOn  the  top of this functionality we built a set of instructions for simple
  parallel  computations  framework  using the [5XSCSCP[105X protocol, which allows to
  send  several  procedure  calls  in parallel and then collect all results or
  pick  up  the  first  available  result,  and  implements  the master-worker
  skeleton. These tools are presented in the Chapter [14X8[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  package  also implements a new kind of [5XGAP[105X input-output streams, namely
  input-output  TCP  streams  (see  Chapter [14X3[114X), based on the functionality for
  TCP/IP  protocol  usage  provided  by  the  [5XGAP[105X package [5XIO[105X. Such streams may
  constitute  an  independent  interest for adapting streams-using [5XGAP[105X code to
  use streams across the network.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFinally,  the  manual  describes how the communication by [5XSCSCP[105X goes between
  several instances of the [5XGAP[105X system, but the same behaviour is expected from
  any  [5XSCSCP[105X-compliant  application:  the  set  of  supported [5XOpenMath[105X symbols
  clearly  will  be  different,  but  the rules of communication are precisely
  specified  in  the  [5XSCSCP[105X specification [FHK+b]. See the SCSCP protocol page
  [7Xhttps://www.openmath.org/standard/scscp/[107X    for    the   information   about
  [5XSCSCP[105X-compliant  computer  algebra  systems and other tools developed in the
  project.[133X
